# Integration requirements

- As a minimum the
  [Mastertag](http://wiki.affiliatewindow.com/index.php/Advertiser_Tracking_Guide/Standard_Implementation#Journey_Tag_.2F_Mastertag)
  must be displayed (or script appended) unconditionally on all
  applicable capture pages
- The
  [Mastertag](http://wiki.affiliatewindow.com/index.php/Advertiser_Tracking_Guide/Standard_Implementation#Journey_Tag_.2F_Mastertag)
  must also be present on the confirmation page.


**De-duping clients**

Modifications to the tracking set up is required to allow SaleCycle
visibility of all channels' conversions to close the loop. This can
easily be achieved by the client implementing \[and de-duplicating on
Affiliate Window's side\] via the [Channel
Parameter](http://wiki.affiliatewindow.com/index.php/Advertiser_Tracking_Guide/De-duplication#Channel_Parameter).
Consult a senior member of the team if unsure.

# Tag Plugin

|               |                      |
|---------------|----------------------|
| PluginType:   | SaleCycle            |
| Plugin Setup: | "See Code Below"     |
| Active:       | "Tick The Check Box" |

## Plugin setup code


``` javascript
AWIN.Tracking.SaleCycle = {};
AWIN.Tracking.SaleCycle.clientName = "CLIENTNAME";
AWIN.Tracking.SaleCycle.host = "d16fk4ms6rqz1v.cloudfront.net/capture/";
```



Replace \`CLIENTNAME\` with its real value supplied by !SaleCycle for
the advertiser campaign / program; this is mandatory or !SaleCycle's tag
will not load.

It is optional to declare \`AWIN.Tracking.SaleCycle.host\` however
according to the latest instructions from the vendor we should do it
like above. If a value is not declared then it defaults to
\`app.salecycle.com/capture/\`.

**<u>Inventory</u>**


``` mysql
SELECT
m.id AS 'advertiserId',
m.program_name AS 'programName',
IF(p.is_active = 1, 'Yes', 'No') AS 'enabled',
p.setup AS 'configuration'
FROM affiliatewindow.merchants m
JOIN affiliatewindow.merchant_tag_plugin p ON p.merchant_id = m.id AND p.is_active = 1
JOIN affiliatewindow.tag_plugin_type t ON t.id = p.tag_plugin_type_id
WHERE m.active IN (0, 1) AND
m.account_type != 18 AND
t.display_name = 'SaleCycle'
ORDER BY m.id ASC;
```



==Successful integration tracking calls (served via the Dwin tag) ==


``` html4strict
 <script type="text/javascript" id="_aw_script_N" src="http(s)://d16fk4ms6rqz1v.cloudfront.net/capture/CLIENTNAME.js"></script>
```


...where \`N\` is an incremental index for the number of scripts loaded.

## Ensure appropriate tracking links are used for example:

â€¢ Post Click link to merchant site:
