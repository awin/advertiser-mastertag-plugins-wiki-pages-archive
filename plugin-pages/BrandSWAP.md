# Requirements

The MasterTag should fire on all pages unconditionally.

# How the plugin works

The partner provides tech solutions for advertisers who are working
through the [brand
partnership](https://zanox.sharepoint.com/teams/uk/SitePages/Brand-Partnerships.aspx?web=1)
model. Key aspects:

- their script is loaded on advertisers' (1) website and displays a
  tab/banner that will redirect to another advertiser (2) where
  conversions can occur
- advertiser 1 has a publisher account which allows them to receive
  commission from advertiser 2
- commission is shared between partner and the advertisers' (1)
  publisher account via the service partner model, where BrandSwap is
  the service partner

For the partnership to work the partner must have the corresponding
memberships, as described above. Should you face issues with commission
not tracked/shared correctly, please get in touch with the Strategic
Partnerships team who will assist with ensuring all memberships are
created correctly.
