**Advanced Click Storage**

This plugin when enabled saves the AWC in two extra storages. These
storages are the localstorage and the cache. This will help ensure that
the AWC is present for the tracking even when it might have been removed
from the cookie storage. Additionally, adds to the sread calls a
parameter named awc_st for analyses purposes.
